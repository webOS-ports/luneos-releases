# Public release images for LuneOS

In this repo we will provide public release images of LuneOS from time to time.

Due to some issues with our build infrastructure, we cannot provide the images from our builder at the current time like we did previously. Instead we're (temporarily) hosting them here for now.

**Please note that these images are built locally by our developers, these images *should* be trustworthy and are provided as service to the community. 
NEVERTHELESS USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK**

There is always the option to [fully build your own images yourself](https://github.com/webOS-ports/webos-ports-setup/) in case you would want to do this. 

Any issues you encounter you can [report here](https://github.com/webOS-ports/luneos-testing/issues)
